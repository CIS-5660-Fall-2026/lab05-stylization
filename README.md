# lab05-grammars
Let's practice using grammars! For this lab, please pull up the L-system node in Houdini.

## 1. Wheat grammar puzzle
Look at these iterations (n = 1, 2, 3) of a one-rule grammar. Using the built in symbols in Houdini, design a grammar that produces this output. Take a screenshot of your rules.\

## 2. Square grammar puzzle
How about this one? Take a screenshot of your rules.\

## 3. Custom plant
Choose a plant in the world. Working off a reference, design a grammar that mimics the structure of that plant. Unlike our simple puzzles, please use multiple rules for greater complexity. Think carefully about the structure of your grammar! EXPLAIN the structure of your plant in the README. What are the components? What do each of the rules do? Be sure to also include images of a few iterations of your output plant. 

### Result
This tree has a trunk that goes straight up, and then branches that grow directly to the side. I did this by creating the trunk in the premise so that it's created only once. Then I have a rule that creates three main branches from the trunk, as well as a rule that branches multiple times from a stem in different directions. I have an intermediate rule that does this branching on the main three trunk branches to add more detail. I tuned the randomness, angle, step size, and thickness scale to try to match the reference picture.
